#### i. How is lodgepole growth is affected by its environment?
- To answer this we will the possible explanatory factors and identify which are most significant, as well as outline the relationship (positiv, negative, exponential, etc.)

#### ii. What environments are conducive to lodgepole growth?
- To answer this, we will use the fitted model and identified significant variables to develop a framework of what combination of variables results in high growth. 

#### iii. Given the environmental data for areas the FIA was not able to survey, what is the predicted basal area of the trees in that area?
- To answer this, we will use our model to predict values for the plots provided. 




## [2. Exploratory Data Analysis]{.underline}
Output not normally distributed. Several variable appear to be non-linear. Some appear to maybe not be impactful, but will need to analyze. 

## [3. Desired Attributes]{.underline}
#### Model attributes required from the research questions
The research goals require a model with the ability to identify important factors, and that can predict. 

#### Model attributes required from the data 
The data show the selected model will need to address non-normality of the measure of interest. Also, the model will need to account for non-normality. 

#### Any other anticipated problems
We do not anticipate any other problems in the data. 







## [4. Proposed Method]{.underline}
### Appropriate models
For this analysis, Generalized Additive Model (GAM) will be appropriate. For each factor, I will need to determine whether the relationship appears to be linear or not, and whether the variable itself should even be included. 

### Specific model proposal
We propose using a GAM, following the example format of:
$$
Y = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^n [ \beta_i f(X_i)] + \epsilon : \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)
$$

where $n$ is the number of explanatory factors that end up being included in the model.

The specific functions applied to each factor will be determined as part of the analysis (some will be linear, some will likely be splines).

### Method strengts/weakness

#### i. How this method accounts for issues in the dataset
We can use this modeling method to account for non-linearity in the data. It can also capture the linearity of other factors.

#### ii. How this method accomplishes research/analysis goals and yields appropriate estimators
This model accomplishes our research goals by allowing us to identify the relationship between the factors and the outputs, as well as provide predictions. 

#### iii. How this method will answer the research questions
We will be able to review the relationships outlined in the model to see if there are diminishing returns on extracurricular activities, and identify if English as a second language is a barrier to learning. This will also allow us to see which factors are most impactful on score, and will indicate which actions we should suggest to improve score. Finally, this model does allow for prediction, and we will be able to compare it to other models which allow for prediction. 

#### iv. What assumptions are needed to use the model adequately? Are they reasonable to assume and explained well?
To use this model effectively, for the linear components we need to match the normal LINE assumptions. These assumptions do appear safe to assume for the linear factors. For the non-linear factors, the model does not have any inherent assumptions we need to meet.
